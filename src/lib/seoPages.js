      question: "How does my project appear on OpenSource Radar?",
      answer:
        "There's nothing to sign up for. Radar searches all public GitHub repositories, so any open issue labelled “good first issue” with nobody assigned can appear. Unassign issues nobody is working on, so they show up as available.",
    },
    {
      question: "What makes a good first issue?",
      answer:
        "A small, clear task: say what's wrong, where in the code to look, and what “done” means. Link the files involved and how to run the tests. If a beginner would need to understand the whole project, it's not a first issue yet.",
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly should we reply?",
      answer:
        "Within a few days if you can. Beginners often give up when nobody answers their first comment. Assign the issue when someone asks, and thank them, even when you suggest changes.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is the friendliness check worked out?",
      answer:
        "From your recent public issues and pull requests: how long maintainers take to post a first reply, how many pull requests from outside contributors get merged, and whether you have a contributing guide and automatic checks. It's a rough guide from a small sample, refreshed daily.",

export const FAQ = [
  {
    question: "What is a good first issue?",
    answer:
      "It's a task that a project's maintainers have marked as suitable for someone new, usually with the “good first issue” label. These tasks are often small and well explained, so you can learn how the project works without needing to understand all of it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be an expert to contribute?",
    answer:
      "No. Maintainers add this label because they want newcomers to take these tasks. Documentation fixes, small bugs and tests all count, and asking a clear question on the issue is a normal part of the process.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know nobody is working on an issue?",
    answer:
      "OpenSource Radar's “Not taken yet” filter shows issues with nobody assigned. Someone may still have offered in the comments, so read them, then ask to be assigned before you start.",

  tips: [
    {
      question: "What if nobody replies?",
      answer:

    },
    {
      question: "What if someone else opened a pull request first?",
      answer:
        "It happens, and your time isn't wasted. You've learned how the project works, so pick another issue there. It will go faster the second time.",
    },
    {
      question: "How big should my first contribution be?",
      answer:
        "As small as you can find. A one-line documentation fix teaches you the whole process, from fork to merge, and that's the part you can reuse on everything after it.",
